// Shared treatment catalogue + live pricing — the single source of truth for
// book.html and hijama-manchester.html, so the two price lists can't silently
// diverge from each other. Loaded via <script src="services-data.js">, since
// this site has no build step or module system; it defines SERVICES,
// PROMO_DISCOUNT and netPrice() as plain globals.
//
// `sessionMin` on a package is the length of ONE session (the first, which
// is what the calendar books). Single treatments get theirs parsed from
// `time`. functions/_services.js mirrors both as `min` — keep in step.
//
// index.html's booking widget keeps its own separate HB_SERVICES /
// HB_PROMO_DISCOUNT copy (see CLAUDE.md) — it predates this file and has its
// own quirks (badges, no desc on non-package items), so it wasn't folded in.
