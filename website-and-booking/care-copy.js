// The "Modesty and care" wording — the ONE place it lives.

// A plain classic script (no `export`), same pattern as venue-copy.js / aftercare-copy.js: book.html and intake.html load it with
// <script src="/care-copy.js"> and it defines CARE_COPY on the global object; the Pages Functions import it for its side effect
// (functions/_care-copy.js) so the confirmation email says exactly the same thing. The two FAQ entries (index.html and
// hijama-manchester.html, incl. its FAQPage JSON-LD) are static text for search engines — tools/test-care-copy.mjs fails if any
// of them drifts from `faqQuestion` / `body` below. Change the words here and nowhere else.
